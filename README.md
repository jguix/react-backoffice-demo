This project is a simple demo of a React backoffice system with the following features:

- Public login page and private pages
- CRUD pages for customers and products, with infinite scroll pagination

It can be used as a seed for other projects, since it is very unopinionated. Only React and a few libraries have been used. The included technologies and libraries are:

- React
- Redux
- SASS
- Typescript
- Axios

It uses [JSON-Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) as a mocked backend server and [Faker](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js) for database generation.
